<p>Drug lords devise a scheme to steal plans that need to be explained in layman terms for ransom under the watchful eye of corrupt US diplomats.  The plot twists when the Drug lords threaten to blow up the White House even after their demands are met.  Millions of lives are at stake unless an ex-con with a big heart can learn to trust humanity again and stop the Drug lords once and for all.  The movie ends with a mildly comical and/or ironic scene in which the Drug lords blow up or go to prison.  Another satisfying tale of political intrigue and personal redemption closes, and we all walk away from this movie a little wiser.</p>
<p>Communists devise a scheme to smuggle an impressive amount of cocaine for ransom under the watchful eye of corrupt Gypsie nationals.  The plot twists when the Communists hijack a shipment of nuclear warheads even after their demands are met, unless a sassy cop with street smarts can quell his pride long enough to stop the Communists once and for all.  The movie ends with a mildly comical and/or ironic scene in which the Communists blow up or go to prison.  Another satisfying tale of political intrigue and personal redemption closes, and we all walk away from this movie a little wiser.</p>
